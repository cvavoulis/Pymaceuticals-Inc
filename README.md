#Description
For this assignment, we were tasked to analyze the data from a drug trial on mice, focusing on the effects of four conditions: Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and placebo. We examined the effects of these drugs on tumor growth, metastatic spread, and survival rates across the 45-day study.

I performed the following:

* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
* Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
* Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
* Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
